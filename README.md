# Super Duper Basics
   This is a plain shader pack for Java Optifine with functions and effects included and an organized shader pipeline based from Super Duper Vanilla. Created as a base for Super Duper Vanilla in case I overhaul/rewrite the entire shader pack.

   This pack's purpose is to also test if the organized shader pipeline I created is viable for creating fast shader packs.

   The name is of course, based off from the original shader pack.
